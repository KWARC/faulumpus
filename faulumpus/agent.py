            This method is called when a new game is started.
            `firstSquare` contains information on the square that you landed on in the form of a dictionary.

                'Type': 'grass',              # not very important
                'IsSight': True,              # the square contains a sight
                'NameOfSight': 'SÃ¼dmensa',    # name of the sight (irrelevant)
                'Smell': False,               # no smell here

                '5,2' means that you want to explore square (5, 2). Other coordinates are analogous.
            You can return a single move in the list (e.g. ['FINISH']).
            To save time, you can also return multiple moves at once (e.g. ['2,3', '2,4', '3,3']).
